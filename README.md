# Lead-Score-Case-Study
   
X Education sells online courses to industry professionals.

X Education gets a lot of leads , its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted.

To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads , also known as ‘Hot leads’.

If they successfully identify this set of leads , the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

# Business Objective :

        X Education wants to know most promising leads

        For that they want to build a model which identifies the hot leads.

        Deployment of the model for future use.
